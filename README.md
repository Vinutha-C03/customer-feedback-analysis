This project performs sentiment analysis on a customer feedback dataset using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) and Logistic Regression for classification. It also includes detailed data visualizations to understand sentiment trends over time and by country.

##  Features

- Load and preprocess a real-world customer feedback dataset
- Perform sentiment analysis using VADER
- Visualize sentiment distribution and trends:
  - Overall sentiment
  - Sentiment by country
  - Sentiment by month
- Train a Logistic Regression model to predict sentiment from feedback text
- Evaluate model performance with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
